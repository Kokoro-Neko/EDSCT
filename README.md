# EDSCT
Elite Dangerous Ship Comparison Tool

------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Tool is now functional but missing large amounts of UI, will be working on this soon.
------------------------------------------------------------------------



## How to add new ships to the list
1. Copy the Sidewinder.json file and rename it to whatever the new ship is.
2. Open the file and replace the details with the new ships details.
* e.g. change "ShipName":"Sidewinder" to "ShipName":"\<Name>".
3. If EDSCT is already running relaunch it and the list will be updated.

* Note: EDSCT gets the list by calling "ShipName" from the json files, so whatever you put this as will tell the tool what to list the ship as!
