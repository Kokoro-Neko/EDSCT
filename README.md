# EDSCT
Elite Dangerous Ship Comparison Tool

------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Tool is now functional but missing large amounts of UI, will be working on this soon.
------------------------------------------------------------------------



## How to add new ships to the list
1. Copy the Sidewinder.json file and rename it to whatever the new ship is.
2. Open the file and replace the details with the new ships details.
* e.g. change "ShipName":"Sidewinder" to "ShipName":"\<Name>".
3. If EDSCT is already running relaunch it and the list will be updated.

* Note: EDSCT gets the list by calling "ShipName" from the json files, so whatever you put this as will tell the tool what to list the ship as!

## Known bugs / Technical Difficulties

1. Ship Creator will crash the program if you don't enter in all the fields
2. Dropdown list of ships doesn't update after clicking create button
3. Default values are as of now a hard to read blue (This will be changed)
4. Dimensions of ship now sort of display. First set of dimensions shows correctly but others don't.
