# EDSCT
Elite Dangerous Ship Comparison Tool

------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Tool is now functional but missing large amounts of UI, will be working on this soon.
------------------------------------------------------------------------



## How to add new ships to the list
1. Launch the Ship Creator.
2. Fill out all the details.
3. Click "Save".
* NOTE: If you have the Ship Creator outside of EDSCT's folder you will need to copy or move the Data folder from the Ship Creators folder to EDSCT, otherwise if you have them in the same folder they will share the same data folder.

## How to update outdated/incorrect ships
1. Launch the Ship Creator.
2. Click "Load".
3. Fill in missing/correct details.
4. Click "Save".

## Known bugs / Technical Difficulties

## TODO:
1. Redesign UI to use tables.
2. Find more to do.
